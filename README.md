# Scraping Data

To scrape data, run a crawl file. This is the filename of the json file in the crawls folder excluding the path.

```
docker-compose run
```

## Local Development

To find the xpaths, you can debug with the scrapy shell like so.

```
docker-compose run --entrypoint scrapy scraper shell <some-url>
```
